        Dear Lanlord,<br /><br />
        
        Thanks for your interest in Live Well Chicago, here is a short summary of who we are and why we are an excellent choice to help you find qualified tenants for your current and upcoming availabilities.
        <br /><br />
        Live Well Chicago is different from other agencies because unlike others all of our agents are highly experienced and extremely motivated each with seven to twelve years of leasing experience. These agents solely work as full time leasing professionals, and have specialized in leasing over the duration of their real estate careers. This experience will take better advantage of any prospective renters that view your property and will also assure accurate information and complete professionalism from start to finish of the leasing process.
        <br /><br />
        The rental process begins with advertising the available apartment, fielding calls, screening prospective tenants, showing the unit, taking applications, employment verification, current landlord references, running credit through the #1 residential screening service in the industry, and finally presenting the completed application to the owner/landlord for approval. Upon approval Live Well Chicago can either turn the applicant over to you or handle the lease signing on your behalf.
        <br /><br />
        Live Well Chicago makes the leasing process easy and smooth for the landlord and for the renter, which makes for a generally convenient process and encourages a longer stay for the tenant!
        <br /><br />
        Please feel free to contact us by phone or e-mail with any questions or instructions regarding the listing/showing of your available apartments.
        <br /><br />
        Thanks for your time and consideration
